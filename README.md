# Pacmann_MySQL_Project

*Chapter 1 - Background* 
This is a simple Data wrangling and analysis project set up by the Pacmann.io team. The data in this project is taken from a Brazilian e-commerce site. The data is available [here]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).

*Chapter 2 - Tools and Methodology
The tools used to do the project are MySQL Workbench and Jupyter Notebook, as well as Python libraries like Seaborn, Matplotlib, pandas, and NumPy. We first download the data from Kaggle in .csv files, then use MySQL Workbench to compile and manipulate the data, and export it into a compied .csv. Then, it is imported to Jupyter Notebook environment to be further analysed with pandas and Seaborn. The files used in the project are then uploaded to GitHub. The conclusions are written in this note on GitHub.
